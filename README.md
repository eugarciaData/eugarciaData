### 2. **Lead Scoring (Data Science)** (Link Soon)
- **Description**: A Data Science project to create a model predicting the likelihood of customer conversion using machine learning techniques.
- **What I learned**:
  - **Data preprocessing**: Analyzing historical customer data to extract key features that can predict their behavior.
  - **Supervised modeling**: Implementing techniques like logistic regression and decision trees to assign scores to each customer.
  - **Model evaluation**: Calculating metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.

### 3. **Business Analytics - Discovery** (Link Soon)
- **Description**: A business analytics project to identify ideal districts for investment, using data analytics and data science techniques.
- **What I learned**:
  - **Data exploration**: Descriptive analysis to identify trends and patterns in geographical and economic data.
  - **Data segmentation**: Using clustering and feature analysis to create profiles of potential investment zones.
